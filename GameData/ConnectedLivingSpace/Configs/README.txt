CLSStock.cfg
------------

This base config for CLS allows for the parts in the stock game to be passable based on an interpretation of the function of the part (i.e. "that capsule is supposed to have a heatshield on the bottom, I will make it impassable").

Note this is the version that is set up by default.


CLSStockFreedomAddon.txt
------------------------

This optional additional config for CLS allows for some more stock parts to be passable, based on an interpretation of the textures (i.e. "that looks a bit like a hatch, I will make the node passable").

If you want more freedom in CLS, rename the file, changing its file extension to .cfg:

CLSStockFreedomAddon.txt --> CLSStockFreedomAddon.cfg

To return to the default config, just rename the file back to its original name.
